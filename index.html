           <p class="text">Andie Stephens, the associate director of The Carbon Trust (corporate carbon measuring agency), explains that there are two sides to the environmental impact of social media: “First, there is the manufacturing, use and disposal of the devices that you access social media platforms on, such as smartphones, laptops and desktops. Then there is the background infrastructure required to provide access to those platforms, which includes things like data centres, internet routers and the base stations that make mobile internet accessible. The biggest part is the energy needed to power devices and data centres. With data centres – which can get very hot from all the equipment consuming a lot of electricity – a significant part of the total energy use comes from the need to provide large amounts of cooling to keep things operating smoothly. Then you have to consider the manufacturing, which often requires the mining of metals and use of hazardous chemicals.”<sup>1</sup></p>
